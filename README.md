# Twitch-OBS-Popouts
Custom CSS to style the Polls and Prediction pages for OBS

You can find your respective pages here (just replace TwitchUsername): 
Predictions: https://www.twitch.tv/popout/TwitchUsername/predictions/summary
Polls: https://www.twitch.tv/popout/TwitchUsername/poll

## HOW TO USE:
* Add the link as a Browser Source in OBS
* Make the Width and Height 400px
* Paste this whole file into the Custom CSS box in the browser properties.
* You will need a Chroma filter (for green #00ff00) to remove the background
